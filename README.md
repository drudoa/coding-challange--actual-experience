# Challange

Write a well-styled SPA using React and Redux that allows a user to see crimes centred around a user-selected geographical location, using the dataset provided by Street level crime [crime (police.uk data) - Datasets](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/bb2c3b16-6719-4e00-ae75-48dd462cb915/street-level-crime-police-uk-data) [(as json)](https://data.police.uk/docs/method/crimes-at-location/). Display the data in at least two visualisations of your choosing, such as a map and a bar chart, or perhaps use scatter charts and doughnuts - it's entirely up to you!

Feel free to use whatever additional libraries and tools you desire, just make a note of why you chose them, but try to avoid using **create-react-app** if possible. We want to see what choices you make, rather than choices made by others. You are free to use the internet as much as you like to write the app, but don't forget to credit any solutions you use.
